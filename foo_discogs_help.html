<div class="level3">
<p>
    New to foo_discogs 2.0, information from the Discogs database is now mapped to tags via user-defined tag formatting strings. The advantage of flexible  tag mappings over the old, hardcoded tags, is that users now have exact control over what tags they write and how they write them. Post-processing of the hardcoded tags generated by foo_discogs 1.0 using other components is now a thing of the past.
</p>

<p>
    Tag formatting strings are an extension of foobar2000 titleformatting strings. The general syntax is similar, but our extension is quite a bit more complicated. You ought to understand titleformatting syntax before attempting to understand our extended tag formatting syntax.
</p>

<p>
    The underlying data that tag formatting strings operate on is loaded from the Discogs Database for the release and tracks being tagged and accessed via variables provided internally by foo_discogs. We've aimed to expose as much information from the Discogs API as we can, and to expose information in a hierarchical, object-oriented manner. These data fields and how they are accessed are described in detail in the following section.
</p>

<p>
    The biggest complication that foo_discogs' tag formatting strings has over normal titleformatting strings is support for arrays. Users may wish to write multi-value tags, which requires an array of tag results for a single tag. Additionally, much information available from the Discogs database is provided in the form of an array of values rather than a single value. Any scripting language to effectively perform tag mappings needs to support arrays.
</p>

</div>


<h3><a name="objects_and_fields" id="objects_and_fields">Objects and Fields</a></h3>

<div class="level3">

<p>
    Key to tag formatting strings are the data that's loaded from the Discogs API and exposed via variables, or fields, for the scripts to operate on and ultimately write to tags. As with  titleformatting strings, fields are accessed by wrapping their name with in % symbols, eg. %RELEASE_TITLE%. The name of a field specifies which data it is retrieving from the data model.
</p>

<p>
    All exposed data attributes come from an "object" in the data model. All objects expose attributes, otherwise they would be useless. Many objects also expose sub-objects of their own. All tag formatting fields refer to attributes of an object, but they may be accessed through various paths of sub-objects. The following table lists the objects in the data model.
</p>

<table class="inline">
    <tr>
        <th> Object </th><th> Description </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> RELEASE </td><td> A Discogs release. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> TRACK </td><td> A track from a Discogs release. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> DISC </td><td> A disc parsed from the tracklist of a Discogs release. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> ARTIST </td><td> A Discogs artist. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> MASTER_RELEASE </td><td> A Discogs master release. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> LABEL </td><td> A label or company associated with the release. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> SERIES </td><td> A series, a group of releases by theme. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> FORMAT </td><td> A release medium format description. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> CREDIT </td><td> An accreditation of an artist. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> IMAGE </td><td> A release or artist image. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    These objects are arranged in a hierarchy. At the top-level, there are a handful of root objects in the hierarchy. All tag formatting fields must begin at one of these root objects. The following table lists the available root objects.
</p>

<table class="inline">
    <tr>
        <th> Root Object </th><th> Description </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> RELEASE </td><td> The Discogs release selected via the find_release dialog. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> TRACK </td><td> The track from the Discogs release's tracklist that this file was matched with on the release dialog. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> DISC </td><td> The disc from the Discogs release's tracklist that this track belongs to. Parsed by foo_discogs from the Discogs tracklist. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> MASTER_RELEASE </td><td> The Discogs master release that this release belongs to, if applicable. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> ARTISTS </td><td> The artist(s) for the matched track, if applicable; otherwise, the artist(s) for the release. Technically, this is not a true root object, but a shortcut for the sub-objects TRACK_ARTISTS "or" RELEASE_ARTISTS (whichever is defined first).</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Non-root objects can only be accessed as sub-objects via a parent object, ultimately stemming from a root object.
    The following table lists the sub-objects available for each object. The type of the sub-object should be obvious from its name.
</p>

<table class="inline">

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> MASTER_RELEASE </td><td> DISCS </td><td> array </td><td> DISC </td><td> Discs for the master release. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> MASTER_RELEASE </td><td> TRACKS </td><td> array </td><td> TRACK </td><td> All Tracks for the master release.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> MASTER_RELEASE </td><td> MAIN_RELEASE </td><td> single </td><td> RELEASE </td><td> Main release for this master release.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> ARTIST </td><td> IMAGES </td><td> array </td><td> IMAGE </td><td> Images for the artist, if available. </td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Sub-objects are traversed by concatenating their name after the parent object and an underscore (_), eg. DISC_FORMAT. To reiterate, all fields must start at root objects. For some fields, you may need to descend multiple layers of sub-objects, eg. RELEASE_CREDITS_ARTISTS.
</p>

<p>
    Of course objects themselves, including sub-objects, are not the goal of fields. It is the data attributes of the objects that we are ultimately accessing by these fields, so any field name that terminated in an object or sub-object name (ie. %RELEASE%, %DISC_FORMAT%) would be incomplete and would not resolve to anything. Here are the data attributes exposed from each object.

<p>
    As with sub-objects, attributes are accessed by concatenating their name to after an underscore (_), eg. %DISC_FORMAT_QUANTITY%. We now have a complete data field variable: it begins at a root object, terminates at an attribute, and is wrapped with the % symbol.
</p>

<p>
    Note: Some sub-objects, such as artist and labels, are not fully loaded from the release. In the past, foo_discogs v1 loaded these before writing tags, knowing in advance what fields were needed. In foo_discogs v2, these fields trigger additional loading from the Discogs API while writing tags. Hence, using fields like ARTISTS_PROFILE will result in additional loading and slower tag writing.
</p>

<p>
    Note: if fields are missing, undefined, or not applicable, they return empty strings (or arrays of empty strings).
</p>

<p>
    It's impossible to go further without finally discussing arrays. While arrays are the subject of the next section, we should first describe how they relate to fields. As shown in the above chart, fields can either return a string or an array of string values. Furthermore, sub-objects that are denoted as type "array" will wrap all of their attributes in an array. Therefore, if an array field is accessed via an array sub-object, or a string field via an array sub-object of an array sub-object, a nested array will be the return type. Only one root object, ARTISTS, is of array type.
</p>

<p>
    Fields that return arrays are written with triangular brackets placed around their name, eg. %&#60;ARTISTS_NAME&#62;%. Fields that return a nested array (an array within an array) require multiple layers of triangular brackets, eg. %&#60;&#60;RELEASE_DISCS_TRACKS_NAME&#62;&#62;%. This rule is enforced in tag formatting strings for the sake of clarity and explicitness. You should always understand what exactly is being returned from a data field. Otherwise, you won't know how to manipulate it or what is being written to the tag.

    To extend titleformatting scripting with arrays, we have encoded arrays inside strings using special, non-character bytes as markers. As a consequence, unfortunately, builtin titleformatting functions cannot be used on foo_discogs arrays, as they are not aware of our encoding, will likely cause corruption, and will almost certainly not work as intended. Instead, we have re-implemented most of the builtin functions with their name prefixed with "multi_" (because the default functions cannot be overwritten). They will be described in the section on functions.
</p>

<p>
    In the examples in this document, arrays will be denoted between square brackets, ie. [abc,def,ghi] is an array consisting of the elements "abc", "def", and "ghi". Because arrays can be nested arbitrarily, we need some terminology to talk about their dimensions.
</p>

<p>
    The "depth" of an array A, denoted as D in our discourse, speaks to level of nesting of arrays inside it. For example, [a,b,c] is an array of depth 1, [[x,y,z]] of depth 2, and [[[]]] of depth 3. An array of depth 0 is a simple string. An array of depth 2 contains sub-array(s) of depth 1. You'll notice that [[x],[y],[z]] is also an array of depth 2. Hence, depth alone is not enough to know the shape of an array.
</p>

<p>
    The "width" of an array is its length. For example, [a,b,c,d,e] has width 5. An array of depth 2's width is its immediate number of sub-arrays. For example, [[x,y,z]] has width 1 while [[x],[y],[z]] has width 3.
</p>

<p>
    The "shape" of an array generally refers to its depth, its width, and the width of each of its nested sub-arrays. We don't attempt to quantitatively define the shape of an array. We only discuss it because some operations (ie. functions) on arrays only make sense when the array conforms to a certain shape, and most operations on multiple arrays only make sense if the arrays are of compatible shape.
</p>

<p>
    To write a multi-value tag, the tag formatting string for that tag should resolve to an array. Each value in the array will be written as a value to the tag. Note: Empty strings are always ignored when writing to tags.
</p>

<p>
    Arrays are coerced into a simple string by joining their elements. There are two cases where foo_discogs implicitly joins arrays (using ", " as the delimiter; see function $join(A) described below). The first case is if a tag formatting string returns an array of depth > 1. The array will be coerced to depth 1 by joining its nested sub-arrays. The second case is when a field that returns an array is not accessed with triangular braces (eg. %ARTISTS_NAME% instead of %&#60;ARTISTS_NAME&#62;%).
</p>

<p>
    Note: The depth of arrays is issumed to be uniform. For example, an array cannot have one sub-array of depth 2 and another of depth 1.
</p>

<p>
    The following special functions all deal with array operations. Most builtin titleformatting functions cannot be used on foo_discogs arrays. Hence, many of the builtin functions are reimplemented below, prefixed with "multi_".
</p>

<p>
    Most functions operating on arrays operate at a certain depth. When we say that a function operates at depth 0, we mean that it operates on the outermost nested array. At the opposite extreme, a function operating at depth D (where D is the depth of the array), is operating on the individual strings at the bottom of the nested arrays. A function operating at depth D-1 is operating on an array of depth 1. For example, given A = [[[a,b,c]]], an function operating at depth D-1 is operating on [a,b,c], a function operating at depth D on a, b, and c, and a function operating at depth 0 on [[[a,b,c]]] as a whole.

<p>
    Note: $multi_if and other boolean functions are slightly different than their builtin counterparts. The builtin functions are based on a truth value that is not accessible to custom functions, so the custom functions instead treat an empty string as false and anything else as true. Hence, something like $if(%MISSINGTAG%) is false while $multi_if(%MISSINGTAG%) is true, because %MISSINGTAG% returns "?". However, $multi_if($meta(MISSINGTAG)) will be false. Also, $if(X) is false where X is any number or character string, whereas $multi_if() will be true in this case.
</p>

<p>
    All builtin titleformatting functions can be used on arrays of depth 0, or simple strings, the builtin functions that generate strings can still be used to generate strings, and the variable operations (ie. $put and $get) can be used to store and retrieve arrays, since they don't modify their arguments.

<p>
    Finally, let's look at some examples of tag formatting strings, including some changes likely to be popular with users.
</p>

1. Number tracks for the entire release, not starting at 1 for each disc:
<p>
    TRACKNUMBER = $num(%TRACK_NUMBER%,2)
</p>

2. Use master release date instead of release date, if applicable:
<p>
    DATE = $if2(%MASTER_RELEASE_YEAR%,%RELEASE_YEAR%)
</p>

3. Replace "Various" with "VA" in album artist:
<p>
    ALBUM ARTIST = $join($multi_replace(%&#60;RELEASE_ARTISTS_NAME&#62;%,'Various','VA'),$multi_wrap(%&#60;RELEASE_ARTISTS_JOIN&#62;%,' '))
</p>

4. Calculate percentage of track numbers from master release that exactly match track names from release:
<p>
    $puts(a,$multi_count($put(x,$contains(%&#60;RELEASE_TRACKS_TITLE&#62;%,%&#60;MASTER_RELEASE_TRACKS_TITLE&#62;%))))$puts(b,$multi_length($get(x)))$div($add($mul($get(a),100),$div($get(b),2)),$get(b))'%'
</p>

5. Calculate average rating of all releases in a release's master release (if applicable):
<p>
    $puts(RATINGS,%<MASTER_RELEASE_RELEASES_DISCOGS_AVG_RATING>%)$puts(VOTES,%<MASTER_RELEASE_RELEASES_DISCOGS_RATING_VOTES>%)$puts(COUNT,$length($get(RATINGS)))$puts(TOTALVOTES,$sum($get(VOTES)))$multi_round($sum($multi_divd($multi_mul($get(RATINGS),$get(VOTES)),$get(TOTALVOTES))),2)
</p>
